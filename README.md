# JSKoans

These koans are base in the already existing (and old):
- https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans
- https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans

## How to use them:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it
3. Open RunKoans.html in the browser
4. Go about solving all the files the browser indicates until you've reached full green enlightment. Start with `AboutExepect.js`

## ES6

Koans including ES6 on its name change a bit with respect to the former ones since they're ES6, but c'mon it's 2024 now and it's fine to assume we're not gonna use `var` anymore except for this kind of old days educational excercises, so I'll skip the typical  `let` and `const` explanation ðŸ˜‰. 

ES6 koans included here are the essential ones to get to work, but if you're feeling geeky enough once you've solved them, my dear old colleague [@saruba](https://github.com/saruba/) has a buch more ready for you [here](https://github.com/saruba/es6koans).
